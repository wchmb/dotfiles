# - docs     (changes to documentation)
# - style    (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
# - refactor (refactoring production code)
# - test     (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
# - chore    (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
#
# <scope>   is just the scope of the change. Something like (admin) or (teacher).
# <Subject> should use impertivite tone and say what you did.
# <Body>    should go into detail about changes made.
# <Footer>  should contain links, articles, Github issue... (E.g: Github issue #23)
#
# Remember to:
# - Capitalize the subject line
# - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
# - Do not end the subject line with a period
# - Separate subject from body with a blank line
# - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
# - Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body
